Description
    Our analysts have obtained encrypted messages. 
    We saw hand-written notes that indicated the keys as being "3" and "5". See if you can crack them.
Methodology
    Two common ciphers that require two numeric inputs in order to decrypt the message are RSA and Rail-Fence(zig-zag) ciphers.
    In this case it ends up being two Rail-Fence ciphers with 3 and 5 rails respectively.
