Description
    Our analysts have obtained password dumps storing hacker passwords. 
    After obtaining a few plaintext passwords, it appears that they overlap with the passwords from the rockyou breach.
Methodology
    This problem can be completed using hashcat and the rockyou wordlist.
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt finds the passwords
    -a specifies attack mode where 0 is a straight wordlist attack
    -m specifies the hash type where 0 is MD5
    Important to note that hashcat may not display cracked passwords in order
    Make sure to enter them in the correct order
